# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website acting as a hub for sharing my projects and connecting with others. It is built in Javascript using React and Node.js. Please take the opportunity to explore the main branch built at [jakemyers.me](https://jakemyers.me "portfolio")

I took heavy inspiration using [Soumyajit Behera's Portfolio](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio) website as reference.
