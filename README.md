# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website acting as a hub for sharing my projects and connecting with others. It is built in Javascript using React and Node.js. Please take the opportunity to explore the site which is automatically deployed from this repository's main branch at [jakemyers.me](https://jakemyers.me "portfolio")

I took heavy inspiration using [Soumyajit Behera's Portfolio](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio) website as reference.
